        "##Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "As part of the wrap-up on Google's Data Analytics course a hypothetical case study is presented to tie in all elements of the data analysis process as part of the course capstone. The case study persists of a company, Cyclistic, that offers bikes for rent at docking stations to their members or day pass users. The director of marketing intends to expand the company's member base by converting current day pass users into members.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a member of the analyst team, the junior data analyst is tasked with using the past year's user data to uncover the key differences between members users and casual users. Through these insights the marketing team can spearhead a constructive marketing strategy to drive Cyclistic's regular users into upgrading to members.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Cyclistic is a made up brand, the datasets used for this case study are from real world data that will suit the needs of the business questions. The data analyst will use the scenario of Cyclistic's current marketing objectives and the accompanying related user data to demonstrate effective execution of each step in the data analysis process. To recap these steps include **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, **Act**, and each  play an intrinsic role for the successful completion of this capstone project and meaningful deconstructing of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclistic is a bike share company situated in Chicago. The director of marketing, Moreno, believes that the future success of the company depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team the objective is to help everyone understand how the casual users and annual membership owners utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. From these findings the team can facilitate a new approach to turnover casual riders into annual members. The executives at Cyclistic must first approve of the recommendations from this analysis which should be backed by constructive data digestion and meaningful visualizations so that the team can move forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Background\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cyclistic:** A bike-sharing program with over 5800 bikes and nearly 700 docking stations. It is distinguished in offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, thereby promoting inclusivity to users with disabilities or personal apprehensions to two-wheeled bikes. About 8% use these assistive options. Cyclistic is aware their user base persists of mostly leisure riders, whereas around 30% use for daily work commute.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lily Moreno:** Director of marketing and manager of the junior data analyst. Moreno is responsible for developing campaigns and initiatives that promote Cyclistic's programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** Data analysts working together to collect, analyze, and report data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing. Our protagonist joined this team 6 months ago and is learning about the business missions and goals and the role that they play in helping achieve them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cyclistic executive team:** detail-oriented fiends that decides your fate\n",
        "\n",
        "##About the Company\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclistic launched its bike-share offering in 2016 and amassed an onslaught of 5,824 geotracked bikes locked into one of their 692 stations across Chicago. Bikes can be unlocked at one station and returned to another at any time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The running marketing strategy had been to build general awareness and appeal to broad consumer segments. One aspect of this is price flexibility: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Annual membership try hards are Cyclistic members, and the non-premium-customers are referred to as casual riders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cyclistic's money magicians say the money rabbit is in the annual members' hat not the casual riders'. Moreno believes growth in annual member numbers will be key to growth of Cyclistic, notwithstanding the fact that the price flexibility is great for attracting new users. Rather than targeting new customers, Moreno believes there should be incentive for converting casuals into annual members. After all they are already aware of the membership program and chose Cyclistic as their mobility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreno's goal is to convert casual riders into annual members. The team needs to more coherently find out how casual riders and annual members differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing. Thus Moreno and her team wants to analyze Cyclistic user trip data to find trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a complete summary of the case scenario and capstone guide view this [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11fHtGoqsNaB4FnJWbWiRMgdYpCPSjzIy/view?usp=share_link).\n",

        "##**Ask**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the beginning stage of any data analysis it is important to identify the business problems or tasks through a relevant series of questions. Moreno has graciously simplified this process for the jr. data analyst and provided the team with three driving question to guide the future of the marketing program\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic differently?\n",
        "2. Why would casual users want to upgrade?\n",
        "3. How can digital media influence casual riders to buy annual memberships?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answering the first question, how the two user types of Cyclistic bikes differ, is given to the jr data analyst to investigate using company historical data. The findings for this question will be the key influence to answering the following two, so it is important that a thorough analysis takes place. The central stakeholders and audience for this analysis is ultimately the executive team.\n",
        "\n",
        "<hr />\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Prepare**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we're past the talking stage (Ask), we can finally start to undress (the data). By we it is meant the jr data analyst. This is an extracting stage where all relevant data parts are collected, brought home to a central folder, and documented ([consensually](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)). The data here will be from a real world bike-share company that is also situated in Chicago, and who just so happens to have casual and member trip data. It's almost as if Cyclistic is an alias made to disguise this existing company.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project the analyst will be using the previous 12 month records of historical trip data. It just so happens to be a perfectly timed project where the most current data set is from the January to December of 2023. With regards to reliability and originality it is presumed that Cyclistic's data are trustworthy rider logs and not forged based off another company's public records.\n",
        "\n",
        "The months stored for 2023 in the [source index](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) starts from:\n",

        "\n",
        "Each of the 12 month's data will be housed in the folder named '2023_Cyclistic_Trips' on the analyst's google drive. It is understandable that everyone is excited to see the bare data. However, because this project is being done on google colab notebook, there requires a specific procedure in order to fully uncover this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analyst will begin by importing google drive into the notebook followed by mounting the drive into the session storage files.\n",

It is very strange why start latitude/longitude are logged but start station is not. This could possibly be due to not all stations having an id in the system yet. The end latitude/longitudes missing some logs may be due to bikes not leaving the station due to cancellation. However, the end station columns having the least non-null values still remains a mystery, perhaps due to a combination of ride canceling and some stations not having an id. These can be discussed with the manager and perhaps more insight can be gained when calculating total ride time.*\n",

Using `axis=0` allowed the tables to stack the first dataframe above the next dataframe without losing or adding any new fields or values. This is comparable to the `Union All` clause in SQL as opposed to `Join` because it merges two or more tables with matching columns vertically. The `Join` clause will add columns horizontally and fill in empty row values with *null* placeholders depending on the join type. The new table contains nearly 6 MILLION rows of data.

However, it is not necessary that they be removed as filters can be applied now that these outliers are identifed along with where they occur. Although not expected, for this analysis upto a day is a reasonable amount of time to keep the bike. Here only 1,370 rides are above 1,500 mins which is a little over a day.

Very crude path to take.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Due to the slightly higher preference of electric bikes throughout the casual rider's population, making electric bikes exclusive to members or a much higher charge than classic bikes for casual riders will cause incentive to upgrade to membership for those who really enjoy it. There are still the classic bike options that more than 40% of casual rides took place on as a secondary option to leave room for accommodation to casual users. This is a really strong direction to take.\n",
